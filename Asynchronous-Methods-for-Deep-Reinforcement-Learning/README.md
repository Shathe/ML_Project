# Asynchronous-Methods-for-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Using a paper from Google DeepMind I've developed a new version of the DQN using threads exploration instead of memory replay as explain in here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783v1.pdf  I used the one-step-Q-learning pseudocode, and now we can train the Pong game in less than 20 hours and without any GPU or network distribution.
